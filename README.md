#Simple Cipher

I recently came across a coded message in a game and wanted to build a program to help solve it. I couldn't get it to work before I solved the puzzle. I realized that the code was a simple Caesar cipher and thought about how I would write an encoding tool using the knowledge that I currently have.

This isn't the most sophisticated tool, but I have used it to pracitce thinking and anticipating edge cases that would break a program. 

I may return to this project as I gain experience to update it or perhaps embed it into an html page.
